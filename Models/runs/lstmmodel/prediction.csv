datenverarbeitung grundlegend geaendert  fast jeder arbeitsplatz ist mit einem computer ausgestattet  der nach einigen geduldigen stunden und tagen de kennenlernen der wirkungsweise dieser geraete  einen enorman arbeitsvorteil darstellt  dieser vorteil besteht insbesondere der mehr und mehr komfortableren erfassung  verarbeitung und weitergabe von daten  werden die meisten niederschriften von buechern  artikeln  diplom  und magisterarbeiten bereit heute durch textverarbeitungsprogramme bearbeitet und liegen letztendlich al eine dateus vor  neue und schnellere rechner sowie leistungsfaehigere programme machen neben der bearbeitung von text auch mehr und mehr eine integration von bildern  bildsequenzen und tonaufnahman eine niederschrift moeglich  kann z  b  eine
